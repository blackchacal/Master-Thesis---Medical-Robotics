(middle) Centred zoom on the wound point cloud. The perspective is the same as top. (bottom) Different perspective of the point cloud to evidence its non-planar nature. }

\section{Path Planning}

	\caption{Path planning for wound model 1. The green line represents the segmented wound contour. The red line is the planned path. From left to right, the distance between lines, $L$, in pixels, is increasing. Smaller $L$ means more wound filling but also more bioink consumption. From top top bottom, the different paths are displayed. Each line corresponds to a different path planning strategy.}

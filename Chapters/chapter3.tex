\chapter{Literature Review}
\label{cha:literature_review}

3D Bioprinting is a promising technology to solve the increasing demand for organ donation, full-thickness skin replacements and in vitro tissue models. However, it still faces a few limitations throughout its three stages of the bioprinting process. This work intends to propose a solution to some of the problems associated with the bioprinting stage, in particular, the way the bioprinter works.

This chapter will focus on presenting the state-of-the-art on the positioning systems used for 3D bioprinting (both external and internal), and how that relates to resolution, speed and in situ bioprinting. It will also focus on the state-of-the-art of using vision and sensing systems to increase the system's autonomy by detecting the printing site or evaluating the printing process in real-time. Finally, it will discuss the state-of-the-art on path generation for 3D bioprinting.

\section{3D Positioning systems}
\label{sec:3d_positioning_systems}

The positioning system of the bioprinter is one of the most important factors on printing resolution, speed and ability to bioprint in situ. Because of this, the improvement of the bioprinter abilities depends directly on the capacity of this system.

Three dimensional bioprinters come in different shapes and sizes. There exists commercial bioprinters, bioprinters developed solely for research purposes, and open source bioprinters. Although all different, there is something that unite most of the existing systems. They use a gantry or Cartesian system as the positioning system. This only allows printing to occur horizontally and mostly on planar surfaces. Despite their limitations to work on non-planar surfaces, there were some success cases reported \cite{Lee2009_multi_layer_culture_human_skin_non_planar}.

In 2016, \citeauthor{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech} \cite{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}, made a comprehensive review of existing bioprinter technologies. They mentioned ten capabilities of an ideal bioprinter. These are high \gls{dof} in motion; high resolution and accuracy; high speed motion; the ability to dispense various bioink solutions simultaneously; ease of use; compact size; ease of sterilization; full-automation capability; affordability; and versatility. None of the bioprinters assessed had all these capabilities.

This thesis will focus on the first three capabilities and also full-automation. High \gls{dof} in motion allows bioprinting on non-planar surfaces. It is crucial for the transition into clinical applications where cells are bioprinted into a biological lesion site \cite{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}. High resolution and accuracy are important to "enable deposition of bioink solutions with sufficient fidelity to simulate cell placement in native tissues" \cite{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}. If one of the goals is to have "rapid fabrication of human-scale tissue and organ constructs for clinical transplantation as well as high-throughput production of tissue models for pharmaceutics and cancer research" \cite{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}, high speed bioprinting is vital and full-automation can help. In several steps, removing the human out of the loop can increase efficiency.

On the article just mentioned, altogether, fifty-eight bioprinters were evaluated, 17 \gls{ebb}, 33 \gls{dbb} and 8 \gls{lbb} systems. \gls{ebb} systems were all commercial. \gls{dbb} systems were 7 commercial and the rest non-commercial systems. \gls{lbb} systems were all non-commercial. No commercial \gls{lbb} system was available on the market at that time.

Of all bioprinters analysed only one had more than 3 \gls{dof}. This bioprinter was BioAssemblyBot\textregistered which is a commercial system developed by US-based company Advanced Solutions, Inc. It uses a custom-made 6 \gls{dof} robotic arm as its 3D positioning system \cite{Advanced2020_bioassemblybot}. Another interesting aspect is that none of the bioprinters assessed were used for in situ bioprinting. All of them bioprint the construct inside their building volume, which is later transferred to its final destination.

BioAssemblyBot\textregistered is a versatile bioprinting system. It is able to print cell systems and 3D assays; experimental tissue models and microenvironments; organ models; microfluidic platforms; implant systems \cite{Advanced2020_bioassemblybot}. It as a build envelop of 250 mm (w) $\times$ 300 mm (d) $\times$ 250 mm (h) and uses up to 8 different tools. One of the main advantages is that it is able to do other tasks aside of additive 3D bioprinting. It can also do contour 3D printing, pick-and-place and assembling. The main limitation of this system is that it cannot be used to bioprint in situ on humans. Although the robotic arm would allow it to deal with the challenges of non-planar surfaces, it was conceived to work inside a its own clean room environment \cite{Advanced2020_bioassemblybot}. It could be used for in situ bioprinting only for small animals that could fit into the working volume. There is no information available regarding system and printing resolution, or speed.

Having positioning systems with more than 3 \gls{dof} has several advantages to the printing process. The most obvious advantage is the ability to print onto non-planar surfaces. Another advantage is dealing with patient positioning. If a system has to bioprint skin tissue in situ to an extensive burn wound, the system may need to adapt to the patient and not the opposite. This means it must adjust to the patient position and relative position of the bioprinting site. If the bioprinting site has an inclined orientation, a 3 \gls{dof} system will not be able to change its orientation and correctly do the printing work. One last advantage to mention, is considering the possibility of internal bioprinting, i.e., the capability to bioprint directly onto an internal structure like an organ or joint during a surgical procedure. The body's internal environment is highly populated with different structures. This means many obstacles to position correctly the bioprinter deposition system. Having higher degrees of freedom helps the system to evade obstacles more efficiently.\bigskip

Some research efforts tried to use the capabilities of robotic manipulators to enhance the bioprinting process, both in vitro and in situ (internally and externally).

The first work found using a robotic arm for the positioning system was from 2017, in which, \citeauthor{Li2017a_additive_manufacturing_in_situ_printing_dobot}\cite{Li2017a_additive_manufacturing_in_situ_printing_dobot}, developed a system for additive manufacturing for in situ printing. The robotic arm, Dobot version 1.0, from the Chinese company Shenzhen Yuejiang Technology Co., only has 3 \gls{dof} but a different configuration from a gantry. All the joints are revolute instead of prismatic like the gantry. The arm as a position accuracy of $\pm$ 0.1 mm. It has a custom made end-effector with a micro-valve inkjet dispenser and two UV light sources for curing the print. An experiment of in situ bioprinting was done on a 3D printed PLA rat model with a defect site on his back. The defect was a rectangular hole 15 mm (w) $\times$ 10  mm (d) $\times$ 1 mm (h). The bioink was printed at a 3 mm/s with a line spacing of 0.75 mm, using two path patterns. The printed results were good for both path patterns, that were able to "fill the defect site completely" \cite{Li2017a_additive_manufacturing_in_situ_printing_dobot}. Although the results were considered good, the defect site was very uniform. It only presents a small curvature and the shape was completely unrealistic. Also, the relative positioning between the nozzle and the defect site was manually setup.

In 2018, a conference paper by \citeauthor{Jafari2018_robot_system_automated_wound_filling}\cite{Jafari2018_robot_system_automated_wound_filling}, presented the use of a robotic manipulator to do automated wound filling. The system consisted in TX90 6 \gls{dof} industrial robotic manipulator, from the Swiss company St\"{a}ubli, paired with an infrared (IR) stereo camera. The printing speed used was 1 cm/s to avoid splatter. It is relatively slow, but it was constraint of the printing modality and not of the positioning system. There was no information about the printing resolution. An experiment done on paper, where two different inks were printed on top of each other, was used as validation of the accuracy. They presented it as evidence of better results than manual applications, but no precise measurements were shown. They also presented an experiment were they used a foam head with a wound hole that was filled with bioink. It shows that the system could potentially be used for in situ bioprinting. The novelty of this work is the use of an IR stereo camera for wound detection and path planning. This gives the system a degree of autonomy for in situ bioprinting, currently non-existent. This work seems to be the closest in goal and realisation to what is proposed on this thesis.

Another work was presented by \citeauthor{Gome2019_openlh}\cite{Gome2019_openlh} on a conference of \gls{hci} in 2019. Their work consisted in the creation of an open source liquid handling system for biological experimentation. It uses a 4 \gls{dof}, from the Chinese company UFACTORY, as the positioning system. The system is not a 3D bioprinter per se but can also be used for that to a certain level. The robot arm has a repeatability of 0.2 mm, max speed of 100 mm/s, and max resolution of 0.2 mm. Since the system was not exactly a bioprinter, the tests presented were not conceived to validate bioprinting capabilities in vitro or in situ. However, they mention the possibility of "adding UV crosslinking for printing bio-compatible hydrogels" \cite{Gome2019_openlh}, which means the system has the potential for bioprinting.

None of the groups referred did any type of extensive analysis regarding the robot modelling and path planning. \bigskip

Other groups also used more that 3 \gls{dof} for 3D bioprinting in situ but inside the body.

A group from UK, \citeauthor{Lipskas2019_robotic_assisted_3dbioprint_repairing_bone_cartilage}\cite{Lipskas2019_robotic_assisted_3dbioprint_repairing_bone_cartilage}, in 2019, developed a robotic-assisted 3D bioprinting system for bone and cartilage repairing using a minimally invasive approach. They built a custom robotic manipulator specially designed to be used on arthroscopy, a type of \gls{mis}. The manipulator has 6 \gls{dof}, with some range limits on the end-effector orientation. The system has three different end-effector, one for bone machining, another for surface registration and another for bioprinting.

Another example, also from 2019, focused on \gls{mis}, is the Endo AM system which is an endoscopic additive manufacturing tool \cite{Simeunovic2019_endoscopic_additive_manufacturing}. Conceived by \citeauthor{Simeunovic2019_endoscopic_additive_manufacturing}, the system consists on a 9 \gls{dof} robotic manipulator and an extruder. It is based on the Da Vinci Xi system. This article presents a thorough analysis of the robotic system kinematics and dynamics.\bigskip

On another tone, a review of in situ bioprinting studies from \citeauthor{Singh2020a_in_situ_bioprinting}\cite{Singh2020a_in_situ_bioprinting} presents a few approaches that handle the difficulties posed by the body non-planar shape, without multi-axis robots. The review focuses on robotic arm solutions and handheld solutions. Two examples for skin bioprinting are worth mentioning.

The first example is a handheld system developed by \citeauthor{Hakimi2018_handheld_skin_printer}\cite{Hakimi2018_handheld_skin_printer}. The system allows real-time bioprinting of skin-compatible biomaterials sheets on to the skin. Being handheld it can be controlled by the user which will take care of its positioning. Because it prints sheets the positioning does not require high precision and it can done by a person. However, it becomes a highly manual task, more suited for non-extensive wounds.

The other example, developed by \citeauthor{Albanna2019_in_situ_bioprinting_mobile_gantry}\cite{Albanna2019_in_situ_bioprinting_mobile_gantry}, is a robotic system that uses a gantry system fixed on a mobile platform to bioprint skin constructs. The system is uncapable of dealing with inclined surfaces but the mobile plaform allows it to reach most parts of the patient's body and print in situ. A positive aspect of this system is that it can deal with extensive excisional full-thickness wounds.\bigskip

Using multi-axis robotic manipulators for 3D printing is a new trend in additive manufacturing \cite{Urhal2019_robot_assisted_additive_manufacturing_review}. However, from the literature review, the same does not seem to be the case yet on the bioprinting community. Only four systems were found using this kind of manipulators for external bioprinting. One commercial system, an open source system and two research proof-of-concept systems. Of these four, only two were used for in situ bioprinting. The other works mentioned emphasise internal body bioprinting or alternative methods for in situ bioprinting.

\section{Vision/sensing systems and autonomy}
\label{sec:vision_sensing_systems_and_autonomy}

Vision systems are important on the 3D bioprinting scene to confer a higher degree of autonomy to the process. It can be useful both for printing site detection and evaluation, as for printing process assessment. These abilities will increase the autonomy, stated as important for the bioprinters by \citeauthor{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}\cite{Ozbolat2017_evaluation_bioprinter_tech}, and also have the potential to increase efficacy and efficiency.\bigskip

From the works discussed on the previous section, only three used vision or sensing systems.

The first one, the BioAssemblyBot\textregistered, uses a camera inside the working space that is pointed to working area. There is no information on the function and working of the camera available on the website. However, from watching the videos of the robot working it is possible to infer that the camera is used to monitor the printing job. It is unclear if it is for any degree of autonomy. It does not seem to be used for visual servoing because the camera does not change direction and the working envelope of the robot goes beyond the camera's field of view.

The second work that uses a vision system is from \citeauthor{Jafari2018_robot_system_automated_wound_filling}\cite{Jafari2018_robot_system_automated_wound_filling}. They specifically use an IR camera for the purpose of system automation. The camera is used to detect a wound site and plan a printing path fitted for the wound. The wounds were painted with an ink which showed up "dark under near IR frequencies" \cite{Jafari2018_robot_system_automated_wound_filling}. They also used geometrical properties to properly validate the wound site. After wound validation a point cloud was generated and fed to the path planning system. The system was not fully autonomous, because the user had to validate the detected wound site. But after that, the path planning and printing were completely autonomous.

The last work discussed was developed by \citeauthor{Albanna2019_in_situ_bioprinting_mobile_gantry}\cite{Albanna2019_in_situ_bioprinting_mobile_gantry}. In this work, a 3D scanner ZScanner{\texttrademark} Z700 scanner (3DSystems, Rock Hill, SC), was used to scan the wound geometry. The data generated by the scanner is used for wound volume calculation and printing path generation. The path planning was more precise by using the scanner data. They were even able to print two layers, one dermal layer and another epidermal layer on top.

Besides these works, two other were found where a vision system \cite{French2018_free_moving_human_anatomy_via_temporal_coarse_fine_control} and a combination of vision and laser \cite{ONeill2017_3d_bioprinting_directly_onto_moving_human_anatomy} systems were used to track the body motion during printing. The first work uses a Leap Motion sensor that tracks the user hand movement. The second work uses the laser and camera to track the movement along z-axis and a Leap Motion sensor to track X-Y axis. These works are important because they contribute directly to the autonomy of the printing system to print in situ, by dealing with the printing site movement. A simple example for the need of this type of control is to deal with the breathing movement when printing on a human torso.\bigskip

Not many bioprinting systems exploit the potential for automation given by vision and sensing systems. These systems open the door for real autonomous in situ bioprinting.
